This is a good and easy course and prof really did a good job on not exposing too much material to the students with very limited math maturity...

It reviews a lot on the material studied in first/second year calculus. The new material is roughly &#92;(\subseteq \textbf{PMATH 333} \cup \textbf{PMATH 351} &#92;), and some dynamic system, and possibly some computational math.

The prof used `ROUNDUP` in final mark calculation: &#92;(91.1\to 92 &#92;). Wish it could be applied to other courses...
