This course focuses more on breadth and no depth.

The assignments are not hard if you look for help. The questions of assignments are more like, if you know the point of it, then can solve it immediately. Most of them are variants of lecture materials.

By first look, the lectures seem to be long, but this course is more like story-telling with less mathy thinking involved. So basically you can just follow the material without thinking too much on it.

After this course, you will be appreciated how clever some ideas are, like inventions of some schemes or attacks. However, there are still lots of challenges remaining.

There are some fancy drawings I created in the notes. For example, you can scan the QR code in the notes.
