It's foundation, but content is quite dry and repeats some concepts from cs 136... Also, the midterms are often 66 average...
Complete slides are on course website.

One thing which was funny by [Ã‰ric Schost](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~eschost/) was the Burrows-Wheeler Transform on the [chicken paper](https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf).

Check [240e](/cs240e)?
