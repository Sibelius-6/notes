Tbh, this course covers a lot more than 240. It goes extremely fast at the beginning, then it can cover many other data types and concepts, like merge two heaps...

This term was taught by PhD student, then the midterm is extremely hard...

## Remarks
In their conclusion,

> This wasnâ€™t training for your first job (programmer). It was training for your second job (code designer/manager of programmers).
(Based on a quote by J. Malazita)
