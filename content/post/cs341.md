This midterm was brutal... avg was about 65... and last term was about 78, and added 3 marks for everyone...

The material (reduction, algorithms, complexity theory) is pretty standard and straightforward if you have a good prof like in Fall 2019.

The notes above is generated from Spring 2021 offering.
