Textbook: J. Watrous, [Introduction to the Theory of Computing: Lecture notes for CS 360](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs360/cs360notes.pdf), version of June 27, 2017. (A Creative Commons license applies; see the cover page.)

This term's offering was basically following Watrous' text, accompanied by some complementary notes and videos. The assignments are heavily weighted, 63%. To explore more on theoretical computer science, consider taking [cs 365](/cs365) and cs 462.
