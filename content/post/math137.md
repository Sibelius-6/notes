Taught by Jordan Hamilton, who is ~5.0 rate my prof. Extremely clear lecture notes and 1 bonus during exam. Bonus is like: calculating the limit of \\(\lim_{x\to\infty}\sin^2x+\cos^2x\\).

He also holds help sessions before exams, which might have similar questions on exams. Attend them if possible.
