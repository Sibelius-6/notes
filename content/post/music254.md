Listening quiz 1 [review notes](/pdf/1201/music254_q1.pdf). Held on Feb 11, 2020.

Midterm [review notes](/pdf/1201/mus254_mid.pdf) (with definitions blank). Held on Mar 3, 2020.

Prof, [Dr. Laura Gray](https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/laura-j-gray), is so so so nice. She did listen to everyone carefully and provided detailed feedbacks on everything student submitted. You will learn the contents well if you have some knowledge before. Listening to some pieces (or watching operas in the theatre) previously or reading the textbook before coming to the class will certainly help.

It is obviously a music history course. In this course, you will learn the styles, musical features at that time.
