This course is the last standard theory course, which mainly covers the chromatic harmony in 19th century, like augmented 6th chords. The final project/last assignment is to write a Romance, which is fun to write, especially on your own, where you have the full control over the piece. If wanna proceed further, consider taking [MUSIC 371](/music371).
