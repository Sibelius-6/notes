Taught by [William Slofstra](http://elliptic.space/), who is first time teaching this course, and material mostly follows from [Ross Willard's delivery](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rdwillar/documents/CourseNotes/PM347-F14.pdf). This course is pretty well-structured. However, it is also dense. Since this is pandemic version, we don't need to memorize all things off the top of the head, which is good.

Side note: The notes above is recompiled from the [old notes](/pdf/1205/pm347.pdf).
