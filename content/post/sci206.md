As you might have known from reddit or so on, this course is relatively or especially easy if you have learnt some physics from high school. The course does not dive into any mathy things, but only explains every concept in plaintexts, accompanied with some interesting experiments.

The course only has several quizzes, and a final project, which is done by ~ 4 people.
