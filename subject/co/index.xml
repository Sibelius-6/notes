&lt;p>The assignments are not hard if you look for help. The questions of assignments are more like, if you know the point of it, then can solve it immediately. Most of them are variants of lecture materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By first look, the lectures seem to be long, but this course is more like story-telling with less mathy thinking involved. So basically you can just follow the material without thinking too much on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this course, you will be appreciated how clever some ideas are, like inventions of some schemes or attacks. However, there are still lots of challenges remaining.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some fancy drawings I created in the notes. For example, you can scan the QR code in the notes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO 442</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co442/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co442/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/ramsey.png" alt="Featured image of post CO 442" />&lt;p>This course is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~jfgeelen/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jim Geelen&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s favourite course, instead of CO 446, because this course directly starts on theorems and proofs thanks to the foundations of previous courses. His offering during Fall 2012 can be found on &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jlazovskis.com/docs-ugrad/co442.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Dr. Pei&lt;/a>. He used timed tests to replace the normal in-class tests. Since these timed tests are open-book, then we will not encounter any question like prove some results from lecture or write the definition. All questions would then need a clever way to use all theorems and definitions from lectures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As in the notes, this course has four parts: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Combinatorial Games&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_%28game_theory%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Strategic Games&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cooperative Games&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="http://timroughgarden.org/f13/f13.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mechanism design&lt;/a>. Normally all offerings of this course cover Nim as an intro, and Nash. Then different offerings have different emphasis. Offering of David Jao can be found &lt;a class="link" href="https://djao.math.uwaterloo.ca/w/CO_456:_Introduction_to_Game_Theory_%28Fall_2016%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>, which he covered lots of different topic than this F20 offering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course introduces many math foundations in each branch. With these, we can explore further on each topic if interested. Also, &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/econ212" >ECON 212&lt;/a> is the course with the same name. From its schedule, it seems to only cover strategic games with greater detail. Of course, ECON 212 cannot expect their students to be able to take dual or do matching games like CO 456 did&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a hard course no matter which prof is teaching it. Different prof has different focus: some on IP, some on graph stuff, some on NLP, but LP is a big part and much much harder than co 250.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also if you are taking this course (or co 250), you will find some overlap with &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs240" >cs240&lt;/a>/&lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs341" >341&lt;/a> on some algorithm or complexity theory stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion, the most interesting stuff was combinatorial optimization, which you will learn more in co450 and co351.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO 331</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co331/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co331/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/co331.jpg" alt="Featured image of post CO 331" />&lt;p>The notes above is made during winter 2021.

&lt;p>This is not a hard course. It requires some algebra. Also it needs some abstract algebra, which prof will have a chapter &lt;em>Introduction to finite fields&lt;/em>. If you do all assignments, you will be fine on this course!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co487" >CO 487&lt;/a> focuses on a different part of whole coding process. It is not hard if you have a little maturity.

>Jim Geelen&lt;/a>. Legend. Spent 2~3 lectures on introduction of the course topics and how hard is optimization&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a review of rate my prof:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Covers so many topics in an intro to CO course as he is such a smart professor. Difficult assignment, better start assignment early and go to his office hour. When I went to higher level CO courses, I realized how great he is. His class is hard, but makes your life easier in future CO courses.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For example, co 450 students serve the best if they took co 255.&lt;/p>

He did introduced some new topics in enumeration like tilings, but nothing in graph theory, or even less than math 239&amp;hellip; This is more structured with &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~kpurbhoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
