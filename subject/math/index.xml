&lt;p>His notes was summarized, so no need to copy tons of examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He also made a joke with his mic. He went outside to drink some water. When he was still outside the classroom, he said, with his mic on:&amp;ldquo;I know you can hear me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>235 is more well-structured than 136&amp;hellip; If you screwed up with 136, 235 is still ok.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I started to learn LaTeX from this term&amp;hellip; So here is a set of &lt;a class="link" href="https://pdf.sibeliusp.com/1185/math235/math235.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Spiro&lt;/a>. You can tell he is knowledgeable and ways he talks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He coordinated math 237 for this term (and last term). The biggest change is that he no longer used the official coursenote, which is full of errors and bad proofs. Instead, he used Vector Calculus. Also, during these two terms, 12 assignments are required to be submitted, even during midterm week&amp;hellip; Assignments did give a taste of how exams look like, so exams are full of calculations with little proofs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His research interests are Geometry &amp;amp; Topology (maybe more), then he taught pmath 365 during next available term (1191). However, it seems that the lecture was not easy to follow&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many math 148 students don&amp;rsquo;t like this course since drawing \(z=x^2+y^2\) is boring&amp;hellip; They would rather do proofs&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you might see from &lt;a class="link" href="../MATH235/" >math 235&lt;/a>, I learnt LaTeX. So here are some results:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://pdf.sibeliusp.com/1185/math237.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;del>notes?&lt;/del>&lt;/a> (This is for math136/235).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://pdf.sibeliusp.com/1185/math237_more.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Two results&lt;/a> from UW course instructions&lt;/li>

>Dan&lt;/a>: extremely passionate. He designed the course and the course notes (not free&amp;hellip; but you can buy second-handed ones).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took with Mukto Akash. He is nice: even giving lectures when he didn&amp;rsquo;t feel well. However, you might suffer from copying his lecture notes: lots of examples without trimming&amp;hellip; It is good but I was spending lots of my time just copying&amp;hellip; As a result, he was behind other sessions several lectures, then he was only able to state the theorems during the last lecture without giving any examples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I audited &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mpei/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Martin Pei&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s lectures for about 30 minutes. He was in a reasonable speed and reasonable amount of lecture notes. Hope I would take CO courses with him in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="remarks">Remarks
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>This course did cover a good amount of linear algebra. However, I think it might be helpful if it covers a bit more abstract things to solid the idea of proof. Some techniques of proofs require more motivation and inspiration behind it&amp;hellip; So consider taking math 146!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MATH 138</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/math138/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/math138/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/math138.png" alt="Featured image of post MATH 138" />&lt;p>Took with Jordan again. Though I was not in his section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Integration &amp;amp; series is harder than derivatives&amp;hellip; You need to be familiar with all techniques&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Midterm was harder than math 137&amp;hellip; So was final.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be prepared and do all the assignments/practice problems/quizzes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MATH 135</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/math135/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/math135/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/math135.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post MATH 135" />&lt;p>During the first lecture, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_on_friends_and_strangers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>last example&lt;/a> is extremely hard to understand. Fortunately, it won&amp;rsquo;t be tested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then it will introduce some basic concepts like:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Statement: a sentence that is True or False.
Proposition: claim that requires a proof.
Theorem: Strong proposition.
Lemma: Weak proposition.
Corollary: Follows immediately from a proposition.
Axiom: A given truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the course covers number theory and so on. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what math 145 (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>snew&lt;/a>) does:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Logic and Proof (with many axioms introduced)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rings, Fields, Orders and Induction (pmath 347/348)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Complex Numbers (pmath 352)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cardinality&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Factorization of Integers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Congruence and Modular Arithmetic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cryptography (co 487)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Factorization in Rings (pmath 347)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Various Topics in Number Theory (pmath 340/440/441)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So this is pretty much a super set of math 135 in all aspects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have much well-typed notes. Course notes together with lectures should be enough.&lt;/p>

Extremely clear lecture notes and 1 bonus during exam. Bonus is like: calculating the limit of \(\lim_{x\to\infty}\sin^2x+\cos^2x\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He also holds help sessions before exams, which might have similar questions on exams. Attend them if possible.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
