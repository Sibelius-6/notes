The final project/last assignment is to write a Romance, which is fun to write, especially on your own, where you have the full control over the piece.

>Simon Wood&lt;/a>, who is teaching part-time. This course is really like a story-telling course. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely interesting. In this pandemic version, only four term test, each of them covers 3 weeks&amp;rsquo; contents. If you really paid attention to the material, marks will not be bad.

>Test 2 review notes&lt;/a>. Held between Apr 2nd and Apr 9th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a good course on an introduction to cultural contexts&amp;hellip; I think this course is more on musicology: study different music cultural things, like different parts of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get good grades, ensure that you need to participate in the class by writing decent journals. Proofread anything you write, especially on &lt;strong>grammars&lt;/strong> and the examples you are referring to.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Prof, &lt;a class="link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/laura-j-gray" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dr. Laura Gray&lt;/a>, is so so so nice. She did listen to everyone carefully and provided detailed feedbacks on everything student submitted. You will learn the contents well if you have some knowledge before. Listening to some pieces (or watching operas in the theatre) previously or reading the textbook before coming to the class will certainly help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is obviously a music history course. In this course, you will learn the styles, musical features at that time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 271</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music271/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music271/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music271.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 271" />&lt;p>This course covers until the minuet, which is the first instrumental music you might be able to write&amp;hellip; Like music 270, this is a standard music theory course&amp;hellip; It would be good if you get music 270 well (except modal part&amp;hellip;) before this course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The prof, &lt;a class="link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/karen-sunabacka" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dr. Sunabacka&lt;/a>, is nice. She uploaded all class board pictures on LEARN after the class is over. Although the textbook is confusing sometimes&amp;hellip; in terms of some conventions or definitions, she is always helpful on answering questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 117</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music117/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music117/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 117" />&lt;p>Please refer to &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music116" >music 116&lt;/a> for ensemble description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will explain why the photo is &lt;a class="link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/music/about/people/g4yun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>missing&lt;/a>. This was the last term he directed the UW choir. He has been conducting for 10 years. After that, he accepted his position as a full-time professor in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-music/faculty-profiles/gerard-yun/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>WLU&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He reused the piece long time ago: The Gloria by Francis Poulenc, pretty recent one. This music is great in any aspects&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Final thing: It is always amazing to be &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the Choir to feel the music.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 255</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music255/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music255/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music255.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 255" />&lt;p>Took with &lt;a class="link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/kenneth-hull" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Kenneth Hull&lt;/a>, who just retired after this term&amp;hellip; And there were 3 guest lectures (candidate to succeed his position). He said he has been teaching here for 40 years (that is amazing). Not too surprisingly, the successor will be teaching me &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music110" >music 110&lt;/a> during Winter 2020.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course is just an introduction to all types of different music at that time. Pretty good introduction. Then I realized my lack of knowledge compared to the classmates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I just wanted to take a sixth course (stat 230, and not online version). Then because of the time conflicts and inability to override the class, I chose this course to be the sixth. I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan to do music minor at that time&amp;hellip; After I planned to do more music theory courses and history courses, music minor is already there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He said he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t fail you like other faculties&amp;hellip; and yes! He didn&amp;rsquo;t. I got an OK grade. The grade distribution is that simple: 3 in-class tests and a presentation. Tests should be fair if you read over the textbooks (I didn&amp;rsquo;t, then I bought a second-hand version before the final&amp;hellip;) and memorize the melodies of assigned pieces (I didn&amp;rsquo;t). It would be nice if he could post the solutions to the tests afterwards&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I examined Brahms&amp;rsquo; &lt;em>A German Requiem&lt;/em>, especially the 4th movement, which is melodic. Here are some resources:&lt;/p>

Almost all members in Conrad was here to memorize this moment and he was cutting the cake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 270</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music270/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music270/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music270.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 270" />&lt;p>The review notes is created during Fall 2019.&lt;/p>

>Dr. P&lt;/a>. He was great. Sometimes he spent a whole lecture (1h 50mins) on writing a cantus or 4-part chorus as examples&amp;hellip; At the beginning of each class, he played some improvised jazz in different styles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The grade will be determined by lots of aspects: keyboard, singing, quizzes and so on. Get near 100% on each component then you should be fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From Fall 2018, the textbook switched from &lt;em>Laitz, The complete Musician&lt;/em> to &lt;em>Horton &amp;amp; Ritchey, Harmony Through Melody&lt;/em>. The hard copies are expensive for both.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 111</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music111/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music111/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music111.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 111" />&lt;p>Over the years, this course is taught by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.trevorwagler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Trevor Wagler&lt;/a>: French horn player and orchestrator. He is passionate about what he is teaching.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, this course is extremely easy if you have &lt;strong>a&lt;/strong> little background. So &amp;ldquo;this course is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> intended for students with &lt;em>more than&lt;/em> a minimal music background&amp;rdquo; from the official description.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also note that it does not fulfil Music major or minor requirements though it can boost your average. If you have strong musical background, take &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music270" >music 270&lt;/a> instead. 270 starts with a little bit rudiments and then jumps to the harmony part.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Previously I thought choir is just church music&amp;hellip; Then I found the choir can do so many things. We have done some jazz, and one arrangement from one Elgar&amp;rsquo;s ‘Enigma’ Variations (believe it&amp;rsquo;s finale) which is also studied in &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music255" >music 255&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to social in the Choir&amp;hellip; Talk with other people from different faculties, backgrounds. Music brings us together!&lt;/p>
