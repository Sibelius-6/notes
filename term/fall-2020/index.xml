>Jim Geelen&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s favourite course, instead of CO 446, because this course directly starts on theorems and proofs thanks to the foundations of previous courses. His offering during Fall 2012 can be found on &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.jlazovskis.com/docs-ugrad/co442.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Luke&amp;rsquo;s version&lt;/a> has strong bias towards coloring, because of his research area.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO 456</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co456/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co456/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/co456.jpg" alt="Featured image of post CO 456" />&lt;p>Taught by &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mpei/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dr. Pei&lt;/a>. He used timed tests to replace the normal in-class tests. Since these timed tests are open-book, then we will not encounter any question like prove some results from lecture or write the definition. All questions would then need a clever way to use all theorems and definitions from lectures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As in the notes, this course has four parts: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Combinatorial Games&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_%28game_theory%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Strategic Games&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cooperative Games&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="http://timroughgarden.org/f13/f13.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mechanism design&lt;/a>. Normally all offerings of this course cover Nim as an intro, and Nash. Then different offerings have different emphasis. Offering of David Jao can be found &lt;a class="link" href="https://djao.math.uwaterloo.ca/w/CO_456:_Introduction_to_Game_Theory_%28Fall_2016%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>, which he covered lots of different topic than this F20 offering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course introduces many math foundations in each branch. With these, we can explore further on each topic if interested. Also, &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/econ212" >ECON 212&lt;/a> is the course with the same name. From its schedule, it seems to only cover strategic games with greater detail. Of course, ECON 212 cannot expect their students to be able to take dual or do matching games like CO 456 did&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Any introductory game theory book will include the materials on strategic games. Here are a few that are available for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An Introduction to Game Theory by Osbourne. (The first three chapters can be downloaded &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/igt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multiagent Systems by Shoham, Leyton-Brown. (Chapter 3 is an in-depth overview of game theory. This can be downloaded &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.masfoundations.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Networks, Crowds and Markets by Easley, Kleinberg. (Chapter 6 is a good overview of game theory. There are many applications to modern social networks. The book can be downloaded &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

In my opinion, this course is more like a statistical learning theory, not machine learning, because machine learning is more like CS 480 and so on, which just does some magic&amp;hellip; Also, Shai&amp;rsquo;s 245 covers Kolmogorov complexity, which has neat application in this course, though he mentioned in CS 245 (winter 2021), not in CS 485.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 370</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music370/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music370/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music370.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 370" />&lt;p>This course is the last standard theory course, which mainly covers the chromatic harmony in 19th century, like augmented 6th chords. The final project/last assignment is to write a Romance, which is fun to write, especially on your own, where you have the full control over the piece. If wanna proceed further, consider taking &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music371" >MUSIC 371&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SCI 206</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/sci206/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/sci206/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/sci206.jpg" alt="Featured image of post SCI 206" />&lt;p>As you might have known from reddit or so on, this course is relatively or especially easy if you have learnt some physics from high school. The course does not dive into any mathy things, but only explains every concept in plaintexts, accompanied with some interesting experiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course only has several quizzes, and a final project, which is done by ~ 4 people.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
