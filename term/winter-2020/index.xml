&lt;p>It reviews a lot on the material studied in first/second year calculus. The new material is roughly \(\subseteq \textbf{PMATH 333} \cup \textbf{PMATH 351} \), and some dynamic system, and possibly some computational math.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The prof used &lt;code>ROUNDUP&lt;/code> in final mark calculation: \(91.1\to 92 \). Wish it could be applied to other courses&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO 255</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co255/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co255/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/tu.png" alt="Featured image of post CO 255" />&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://pdf.sibeliusp.com/1201/co255_book.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>This is a hard course no matter which prof is teaching it. Different prof has different focus: some on IP, some on graph stuff, some on NLP, but LP is a big part and much much harder than co 250.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also if you are taking this course (or co 250), you will find some overlap with &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs240" >cs240&lt;/a>/&lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs341" >341&lt;/a> on some algorithm or complexity theory stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion, the most interesting stuff was combinatorial optimization, which you will learn more in co450 and co351.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CO 331</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co331/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co331/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/co331.jpg" alt="Featured image of post CO 331" />&lt;p>The notes above is made during winter 2021.

&lt;p>This is not a hard course. It requires some algebra. Also it needs some abstract algebra, which prof will have a chapter &lt;em>Introduction to finite fields&lt;/em>. If you do all assignments, you will be fine on this course!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/co487" >CO 487&lt;/a> focuses on a different part of whole coding process. It is not hard if you have a little maturity. It is more about a broad introduction in comparison to co485.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CS 341</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs341/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs341/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/alg.png" alt="Featured image of post CS 341" />&lt;p>This midterm was brutal&amp;hellip; avg was about 65&amp;hellip; and last term was about 78, and added 3 marks for everyone&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The material (reduction, algorithms, complexity theory) is pretty standard and straightforward if you have a good prof like in Fall 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The notes above is generated from Spring 2021 offering.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CS 350</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs350/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs350/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/os.png" alt="Featured image of post CS 350" />&lt;p>Check the &lt;a class="link" href="https://mdf.sibeliusp.com/1201/cs350help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>This course is not hard to get good marks if you study well for midterm (study the past exams) and spend &lt;strong>a lot of time&lt;/strong> on debugging assignments&amp;hellip; Since clear guides are provided for assignments, then your job is just to follow the guides and then debug&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course, in my opinion, is theory heavy, or memorization heavy&amp;hellip; There are lots of mechanics behind OS. This course introduces some basic concepts behind it and lets us build some features top on a degraded OS provided by Harvard&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note from Spring/Fall 2020&lt;/strong>: From the course website,&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Course content is not changing from previous terms. While it was our intention to begin a more serious overhaul of the course, starting with the assignments this year, it does not make sense to start this process under these circumstances. If you have previously taken the course, the assignments have not changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Because of the pandemic, course&amp;rsquo;s structure cannot be changed. Moreover, midterms/finals are replaced by open-book quizzes/assessments. Therefore, then students really do not need to memorize all things like we did previously for midterms or final.&lt;/p>

>Test 2 review notes&lt;/a>. Held between Apr 2nd and Apr 9th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a good course on an introduction to cultural contexts&amp;hellip; I think this course is more on musicology: study different music cultural things, like different parts of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get good grades, ensure that you need to participate in the class by writing decent journals. Proofread anything you write, especially on &lt;strong>grammars&lt;/strong> and the examples you are referring to.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Prof, &lt;a class="link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/laura-j-gray" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dr. Laura Gray&lt;/a>, is so so so nice. She did listen to everyone carefully and provided detailed feedbacks on everything student submitted. You will learn the contents well if you have some knowledge before. Listening to some pieces (or watching operas in the theatre) previously or reading the textbook before coming to the class will certainly help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is obviously a music history course. In this course, you will learn the styles, musical features at that time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 271</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music271/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music271/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music271.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 271" />&lt;p>This course covers until the minuet, which is the first instrumental music you might be able to write&amp;hellip; Like music 270, this is a standard music theory course&amp;hellip; It would be good if you get music 270 well (except modal part&amp;hellip;) before this course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The prof, &lt;a class="link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/people-profiles/karen-sunabacka" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dr. Sunabacka&lt;/a>, is nice. She uploaded all class board pictures on LEARN after the class is over. Although the textbook is confusing sometimes&amp;hellip; in terms of some conventions or definitions, she is always helpful on answering questions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
