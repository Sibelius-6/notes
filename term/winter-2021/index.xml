&lt;p>The assignments are not hard if you look for help. The questions of assignments are more like, if you know the point of it, then can solve it immediately. Most of them are variants of lecture materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By first look, the lectures seem to be long, but this course is more like story-telling with less mathy thinking involved. So basically you can just follow the material without thinking too much on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this course, you will be appreciated how clever some ideas are, like inventions of some schemes or attacks. However, there are still lots of challenges remaining.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some fancy drawings I created in the notes. For example, you can scan the QR code in the notes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CS 146</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs146/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs146/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/cs146.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post CS 146" />&lt;p>This course is pretty much like Lushman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs246e" >cs 246e&lt;/a> style: lots of things, hard, time-consuming, but learn a lot definitely. (I am creating a circular argument)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This course covers all &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs136" >cs 136&lt;/a> contents in about half of the course. Then the rest discusses more Racket, some &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs245" >cs 245&lt;/a> stuff (program verification), baby compiler and so on. The compiler stuff is almost the same as the beginning and end of &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs241" >cs 241&lt;/a>. So Brad recommends taking &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs241e" >cs 241e&lt;/a> instead of cs 241.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course frequently switches gears, i.e., jump from topics to topics, so doing the assignments will help you keep up with the lecture material.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CS 360</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs360/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs360/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/cs360.png" alt="Featured image of post CS 360" />&lt;p>Textbook: J.

>Introduction to the Theory of Computing: Lecture notes for CS 360&lt;/a>, version of June 27, 2017. (A Creative Commons license applies; see the cover page.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This term&amp;rsquo;s offering was basically following Watrous&amp;rsquo; text, accompanied by some complementary notes and videos. The assignments are heavily weighted, 63%. To explore more on theoretical computer science, consider taking &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs365" >cs 365&lt;/a> and cs 462.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CS 365</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs365/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs365/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/cs365.jpg" alt="Featured image of post CS 365" />&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~eblais/cs365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Prof&amp;rsquo;s notes&lt;/a> is quite incomplete,
by which I mean he deliberately left out the proof and let the students fill in
as a part of the weekly report (40% of this course).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the proofs of the results in this course can be found in &lt;a class="link" href="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs360" >cs 360&lt;/a>. This course covers space complexity which cs 360 doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CS 479</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs479/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/cs479/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/cs479.jpg" alt="Featured image of post CS 479" />&lt;p>This course is advertised as theoretical neuroscience, and uses &lt;a class="link" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/theoretical-neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;em>Theoretical Neuroscience&lt;/em>&lt;/a> as textbook. However, only chapter 1 of this textbook is covered as theoretical material, the rest like information theory was not covered&amp;hellip; This course is more like a standard survey of networks in machine learning, all types of networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that in CNN part (section 7,3), I didn&amp;rsquo;t complete the rest of notes because he was reading off the cs231n slides, stanford course. To obtain a full understanding, you can read their &lt;a class="link" href="https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

The course material is not hard to follow, which describes some basics of map making, and gis system. The assignments are not hard to follow, and they are provide several instruction videos to do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MUSIC 371</title><link>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music371/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music371/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://notes.sibeliusp.com/crs_banner/music371.jpg" alt="Featured image of post MUSIC 371" />&lt;p>This course is like a survey course of all 20th century music: Serialism, Neo-Riemannian and so on.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
